In a party there are n different-flavored cakes of volume V1, V2, V3 ... Vn each. Need to divide them into K people present in the party such that 
- Each member of party gets equal volume of cake (say V, which is the solution we are looking for) 
- A given member should get a cake of single flavour only i.e. You cannot distribute parts of different flavored cakes to same member. 
- Minimum volume of cake gets wasted after distribution so that means a maximum distribution policy
